#Introduction

This project involved building an automated system for real-time incident alerting and response across Windows and Linux hosts. It's based on free and open-source tool, like Splunk as a SIEM platform, Shuffle for automated alerts and playbook creation and Syslog for additional log creation. All of this was created and hosted on EC2 instances on AWS servers.
