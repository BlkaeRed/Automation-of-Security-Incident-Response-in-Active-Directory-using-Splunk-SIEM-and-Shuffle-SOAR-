# Introduction

This project involved building an automated system for real-time incident alerting and response across Windows and Linux hosts. It's composed of free and open-source tools, Splunk as a SIEM platform, incident analysis and alert creation, Sysmon and Syslog for extensive log creation. Additional tools include Shuffle for automated response to alerts like sending decitated message/email to Slack or Gmail of SOC analyst. I tested this system for two attack. First, access for unknown IP address to one of the endpoint and second, potential C2 connection to attacker's server, using execution framework Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.
